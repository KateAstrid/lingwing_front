## Run development server

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Code formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.

There is a pre-commit hook that checks code formatting and fails commit if it
doesn't matches the configuration.

To automatically format the code run:

```bash
yarn format
```
